## Features
- **View Stations by Line**:  
  Easily explore all stations categorized by their respective metro lines.

- **Station Details**:  
  Get detailed information about each station, including available facilities, address, and more.

- **Find Shortest Path**:  
  Calculate the shortest path between two stations using efficient algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.

the project is developed using **compose** for building UIs and implements algorithms for optimized route calculations.
